# COVID-19 Data Analysis Lab

In this lab, you will have the opportunity to follow an expert in creating a solution for data visualization and analysis using Python. Within this context, we have developed an application dedicated to the analysis of data related to the COVID-19 pandemic. For the analysis of this data, we use the Pandas library, widely recognized for its effectiveness in the manipulation and analysis of tabular data, also known as dataframes. After completing the analysis process, we focus on creating engaging and informative storytelling.

## Technologies Used

The main technologies employed in this project include:

- [Python](https://www.python.org/): The core programming language.
- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/): Used for data manipulation and analysis.
- [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/): A library that enables the easy creation of interactive web applications.
- [Plotly](https://plotly.com/): Used to create interactive charts.

## Features

The application we have developed offers the following features:

- Importation of COVID-19-related data.
- Analysis and preprocessing of data.
- Creation of interactive charts for clearer visualization.
- Development of storytelling to communicate insights and trends.

## Access to the Application

You can access the application directly through the following link: [https://dadoscovid-kdbroh9w9gv9zwjeel9vpf.streamlit.app/](https://dadoscovid-kdbroh9w9gv9zwjeel9vpf.streamlit.app/)

The application is hosted on the Streamlit.io website and is connected to GitHub to facilitate access and collaboration.
